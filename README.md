# Recycle.It
This application draws from the Behavioural Insights Team that has been wildly successful in the United Kingdom. To encourage behaviour it must be easy, attractive, social and timely (EAST). 
* Easy: The goal is to provide the user with information in as few clicks as possible, as intuitively as possible. 
* Attractive: A simple and clean user interface that doesn't get in the way of the application.
* Social: 
Idealy this will serve as a tool to help reduce recycling contamination with React Native and Tensorflow.
