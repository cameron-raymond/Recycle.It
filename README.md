# RecycleIt
This application draws from the Behavioural Insights Team that has been wildly successful in the United Kingdom. To encourage behaviour it must be easy, attractive, social and timely (EAST). 
* Easy: The goal is to provide the user with information in as few clicks as possible, as intuitively as possible. 
* Attractive: A simple and clean user interface that doesn't get in the way of the application. Possible rewards for recycling???
* Social: Possible add on, chart user behaviour over time to visiualize increase in recycling (or focus on the impact that proper recycling can have through visualizations). Show how much other people recycle? Add a pledge to recycle once a day that can be tracked through the app?
* Timely: The app will be opened used to picture one thing and then closed. This entire flow should happen in < 10 seconds ideally.

Ideally this will serve as a tool to help reduce recycling contamination with React Native and a custom trained model w/ Clarifai.

Next steps: Training a MLP with TensorFlow and injecting it into the app will be quicker, more cost effective and allow for offline usage.
